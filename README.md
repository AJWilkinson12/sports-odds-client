# sports-odds-client
This application is just a little project I used to get comfortable with APIs. 
It uses 'The Odds-API' to grab information from various bookmakers to get spread information on sporting events.
The language is Java.
IMPORTANT
Right now I have it only set up to search for NFL, MLB, MLS, and NCAAF with US bookmakers.
